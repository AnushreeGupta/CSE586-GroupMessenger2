# Part B Tasks: 
Group Messenger with Total and FIFO Ordering Guarantees and Failure Detection

We were required to implement more advanced concepts in this assignment like adding
ordering guarantees to your group messenger. The guarantees you will implement are total
ordering as well as FIFO ordering. As with part A, you will store all the messages in your content
provider. The different is that when you store the messages and assign sequence numbers,
your mechanism needs to provide total and FIFO ordering guarantees.

This code has been designed to work for 5 AVDS running on the redirection ports: 11108, 11112, 11116,
11120, and 11124. 

Software Used: Android Studio
